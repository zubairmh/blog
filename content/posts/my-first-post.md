# Intro
![Makeathon Banner](https://makeathon5.devfolio.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.devfolio.co%2Fhackathons%2F01784f5b2dfe41f38ea87bd7a8e02b0b%2Fassets%2Fcover%2F99.png&w=1440&q=100)
Makeathon5 was our first hackathon, we participated as team "slimydudes" comprising of:

- Zubair Mohammed (me)
- Parag Goyal
- Rachancheet Singh Kohli
- Reetinder Singh

This was the first time we actually took an initiative to go to an offline event, I believe it was worth the time
Makeathon trained us to develop projects as a team.

# The Project

![Herit](https://assets.devfolio.co/hackathons/01784f5b2dfe41f38ea87bd7a8e02b0b/projects/929553fe72d145939baf2b280268c1f0/4124cf19-def6-4048-a2b4-1ef2e07fd117.png)
We went in overambitious, planned to make a whole decentralized social media platform for travellers. The result was honestly disappointing, but we saw it coming. In personal opinion, I think it's better to work on a smaller but more concrete idea which can actually be implemented within the alloted time frame. For a lot of beginner teams, it is also to pre-distribute the work among all team mates. In short:

- Develop a fool-proof idea
- Appeal to the buzz words that everyone seeks
- Don't develop a social media
- Don't complicate the server architechture
- Make it easily deployable
- Divide the work


## Status
We didn't win the hackathon, but came back home with more idea's. Planned for the future
